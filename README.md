VT-Utils: Vector and Text utilities
===================================

Library that helps to use `Vector` (V, instead of `[]`) and `Text` (T, instead of `[Char]`).

Contains helpers for `Vector` and `Text` conversions, some general-use utilities
and a custom prelude `VtUtils.Prelude` that can be used the following way:

    import Prelude ()
    import VtUtils.Prelude
